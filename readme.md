# FluxEV
The code is for our paper ["FluxEV: A Fast and Effective Unsupervised Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3437963.3441823) 
and this paper has been accepted by WSDM 2021. [\[‰∏≠ÊñáËß£ËØª\]](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/zUQJnbWQx5qf1A_gXnnAbQ)

üòâ About Name: "Flux" means the Fluctuation, "EV" denotes the Extreme Value.     

üí´ Good News: FluxEV has been integrated into [**OATS**](https://github.com/georgian-io/pyoats), a convenient Python library providing various approaches to time series anomaly detection. Thanks for their awesome work!

## Requirements
* numpy
* numba
* scipy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib (plot)
* more-itertools (plot)

## Datasets
1. KPI.        
* Competition Website Link: <http://iops.ai/dataset_detail/?id=10> (‚ö†Ô∏è Seems like the official competition website is down!)        
* Tsinghua Netman GitHub Link: <https://github.com/NetManAIOps/KPI-Anomaly-Detection/tree/master/Finals_dataset>

2. Yahoo.
*  Official Website Link: <https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=s&did=70>

## Instructions
`preprocessing.py`: 
* Fill the missing points for KPI dataset.

`spot_pipe.py`: 
* SPOT function is modified to be a part of FluxEV for streaming detection;
* MOM(Method of Moments) is added as one of parameter estimation methods;
* For the original code, please refer to [SPOT (Streaming Peaks-Over-Threshold)](https://github.com/Amossys-team/SPOT)

`eval_methods.py`: 
* The adjustment strategy is consistent with AIOps Challenge, [KPI Anomaly Detection Competition](http://iops.ai/competition_detail/?competition_id=5&flag=1).
* The original evaluation script is available at [iops](https://github.com/iopsai/iops/blob/master/evaluation/evaluation.py).

`main.py`: 
* Implement streaming detection of FluxEV.

## Run
```
python main.py --dataset=KPI
```

```
python main.py --dataset=Yahoo
```
